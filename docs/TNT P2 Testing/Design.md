- Getting the timing for the right press here is a lil weird to time![[TightRightPress_Design1.png]]
- It sucks for me to test the fatass room because I remembered where the wrench was from the good ol days. I think it is a cool idea to have people explore the core every other attempt people clear P2Intro07, but it can be very scary for the people who cannot find the wrench in like 10 attempts, I'd imagine bozos would get impatient
	- Upon omega further exploring, I realized that it aint that hard to explore to other places - I feel like people will get used to the controls rather quickly, but lets wait and hear what the other testers say about it first I suppose
