- When the player gets teleported over to the other side of the flashing blocks, I noticed the lil balls tracing the player's tp; I wonder if it could look nicer if the lil balls had an outline? Or maybe the subtlety is nice thing - something to think about![[TP balls_suggestion1.png]]
- Should there be a sound effect for when you get a new objective on the map?

- I wonder if the 'X' key to resize the map could be annoying for some people, I know of some bozos who use X to shoot; could the button to resize be bound to the skip button instead?
- I had a few moments when I was going inside this area accidentally and warping all the way to the left, catching me offguard. I also think that removing this column could probably help this part a bit, because it kinda felt random to pull off, and could probably help the former issue![[Suggestions2.png]]
- I'm now wondering if itd be good to force the map size to normal/big to show map/objective changes?
