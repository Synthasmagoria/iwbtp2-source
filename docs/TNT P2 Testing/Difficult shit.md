- So far I found rP2Intro06 to be harder than anything else so far
- I found this jump to be pretty hardge, felt a lil too precise? ![[OmegaManeuver_Difficult1.png]]
- idk if it's cause its late and im tired or smth, but this part here is pretty rough to time![[Rough_Difficult2.png]]

- Especially timing the jump to the right blocks, and having to face left quickly; what would usually happen is I start facing left, anticipate the right press I'd have to do on reaching the right, but I'd almost always mistime and pop back to the left
