aight bro tbh i got no clue how this obsidian shit works - first time using it omegalol, but ill try my best connecting shit

im planning to divide the notes between:
- [[Bugs]]
- [[Suggestions]]
- [[Shit I might've thought was a bug]]
- [[Difficult shit]]
- [[Design]]
and have this overview be my overall feelings of the stage as a whole, maybe after finishing a session or some shit

- Man the general vibes of the stage is fuckin immaculate, it may be cause its like 4am or some shit but this feels pretty immersive and I'm only in the 4th room
- Very intuitive platforming so far, but could be because I've already known how the gimmick works beforehand omegalol

- Heeell yea found the tree, bg effects look amazing![[Tree_Overview1.png]]
- Looks like the fatass room got my fps down to around 175fps on YYC, I wonder how Kale's pc might handle that (bros computer is our benchmark omegalol)
- God the 'Between' screen is so fucking cool
- Alright so I've been post-wrench for about an hour I think and I can say for sure that I'm omega lost. What's interesting is that there's a weird feeling in me every now and then where I'm like *"am I really going the right way?"* or *"what am I doing here"*, which if I remember correctly was the feel you were going for. But for me there was also this feel of *"what if I'm wasting my time exploring this"* sometimes, and I think that has a lot to do because the objectives on the far left OOB and P2Intro04 began flashing from the beginning of me getting the wrench item, in other words, it feels like I've been spending too much time tryna find one of these objectives. It's hard to say if this is a weird thing or not because this stage's whole theme is about exploring, and maybe after getting the first objective things get more cleared up, so this is just something interesting I thought to write about. Anyways bro, this was my route for the start![[Route_2506.png]]

- Naaaaaah I'm dumb as bricks, I didn't see this for the longest time?????? I spent a few dozen minutes lost after getting the orange crystal before tping back here, shiiiiiiiit - guess thats life![[Overview3.png]]
- Yessssssss, I love the feeling of finding new shit, feels really insane in a warped stage like this![[Overview4.png]]
- Route I took today:![[Route2604.png]]

### Post clear thoughts
- That's the stage cleared! Hell yea - 551 deaths, ~3:20:00
- Unbelievable attention to detail that is legitimately unparalleled, I can feel the thought and effort you poured into everything in the stage, really well done. I was really immersed from start to finish, every now and then going wild over the shader effects going on, but thats probably cause I'm an omega nerd about shit like that
- Referring back to yesterday's long note: yeah, after getting one of the crystals I definitely felt more at ease with the world and started understanding what you wanted me to do with confidence.
- There were definitely a few moment where I went like 'aaaaah fuck how did I miss that??' but I guess that goes for any sorta exploration game like this so I don't think that's an issue
- Oh yeah and bro the elevator thing - is that gonna be a whole thing? I didn't notice anything in the stage that could indicate to the passcode for the elevator
- And ay, not as bug ridden as you probably thought! (or at least in my playthrough omegalol, I had to try my best to find some of the bugs I found) Even in YYC, I actually can't believe that the only YYC bug arose from the first fucking 2 minutes of me playing, that shit scared the hell outta me, but its all gooooood
